# Air Ticket Price Prediction

## Project Overview
Air ticket prices fluctuate based on several factors such as airline, journey date, source, destination, duration, and number of stops.
This project aims to build a **machine learning regression model** that predicts **air ticket prices** using historical flight data.
The notebook demonstrates an **end-to-end data analysis workflow**, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze factors influencing air ticket prices
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Perform feature engineering on date, time, and categorical variables
- Build regression models to predict ticket prices
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

---

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Lasso Regression  

These models help compare baseline performance and understand the impact of regularization.

## Technologies & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
